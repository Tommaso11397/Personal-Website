    "text": "Work In Progress\n \n\nUnion Delegates Incentives and Firm-level Outcomes (with Francesco Armillei)\nWe study how the electoral accountability for workplace union representatives affects firm-level employment outcomes. We focus on a 2008 reform in France that tied union legitimacy to vote shares and approval thresholds, using administrative data on firm-level employment and collective agreements, and exploiting for causal identification the staggered roll out of the policy determined by firms’ pre-determined election schedule. We find that workers’ annual earnings increase following the first post-reform election. These gains are driven primarily by longer hours worked rather than higher hourly wages, and are concentrated among workers in the lower quintiles of the within-firm earnings distribution. We document a decline in within-firm earnings skewness and a modest rise in dispersion, which we interpret as a reduction in firm-level wage inequality. We further show that bargaining content shifts toward monetary instruments. Taken together, the results indicate that electoral accountability, not only union presence per se, plays a central role in shaping the distributive effects of workplace representation.\n\n• Latest Draft • Slides • Press Coverage\n\n\nUnconditional Cash Transfers: A Bayesian Meta-Analysis of 50 Randomized Evaluations in 26 Low and Medium Income Countries\nUsing Bayesian meta-analysis methods, we estimate the impact of unconditional cash transfers on nine primary outcomes in a sample of 50 randomized evaluations from middle and low income countries. We find strong and positive average treatment effects per dollar transferred on consumption, food security, and income. Critically, given theoretical and policy debates on the topic, we do not find evidence that cash discourages work. We document important heterogeneity along four key dimensions. First, there are important differences by disbursement schedule. Though both stream and lump sum transfers generate increases in consumption and income, the impact of streams flows through food consumption and labor supply while lump sum transfers tend to facilitate asset accumulation. Second, treatment effects across the board show no sign of dissipation over time. Third, effects generally tend to be larger for samples that are less poor to begin with. Fourth, and in line with earlier work, we find slightly diminishing marginal returns to transfer size. Benefit-cost analyses that define benefits as the net present value of the predicted treatment effect on consumption yield ratios between 83% and 414%.\n\n• Latest Draft • Slides • Press Coverage"
