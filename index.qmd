# About me 

<body style="font-family: 'Calibri', sans-serif;">

I am a third-year PhD student in Economics at Bocconi University. 

My main research interests are the intersection of Development and Labour Economics. I am also interested in applications of Bayesian statistics to applied micro economics and meta analysis. 

Prior to joining Bocconi, I worked at the Global Poverty Research Lab at Northwestern University and obtained my MsC and Bachelor in Economics and Social Sciences at Bocconi University.
