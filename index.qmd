# About me 

<body style="font-family: 'Calibri', sans-serif;">

I am a first-year PhD student in Economics at Bocconi University. 

I am interested in development economics and causal inference, especially Bayesian methods and Machine Learning. 

Prior to joining Bocconi, I worked at the Global Poverty Research Lab at Northwestern University and obtained my MsC and Bachelor in Economics and Social Sciences at Bocconi University.
